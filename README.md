The relationship between diet, health, and economics is becoming increasingly evident in today's data-driven world. In America, over 2 in 5 adults are obese, largely due to a diet high in processed meats and sugars. This epidemic affects individual health and strains the US healthcare system, consuming nearly $173 billion in medical expenditures in 2019. Therefore, our report explores the relationships between processed food consumption, obesity, and financial market dynamics. Using rigorous statistical tests and quantitative models, we analyze obesity levels in relation to the production and consumption rates of processed food components. A key highlight of our study is our innovative pairs selection and trading algorithm, which substantiates our hypothesis that stocks of companies producing or using processed food correlated with obesity also show strong correlations with healthcare sector stocks, and it provides a method to capitalize on this pattern. We obtain 7 pairs using this strategy for a Sharpe ratio of 1.58. We find that the strongest correlations are between processed food companies and healthcare sector stocks, highlighting the financial significance of health trends. To refine our hypothesis and trading strategy, we propose gathering additional evidence using SARIMA forecasting models to enhance predictive accuracy, offering actionable insights for stakeholders in both the food and healthcare sectors.
